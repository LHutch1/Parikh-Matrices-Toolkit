Here, you will find all Java classes that are required to compile and launch a toolkit that can be used to complete several different functions relating to Parikh matrices. 

An executable .jar file can also be downloaded. 

Calculations that can be performed as part of this toolkit include, but are not limited to, calculating the Parikh matrix of a word, finding all words that are amiable with a given word, determining if a matrix is Parikh and finding all words that are described by a Parikh matrix.
